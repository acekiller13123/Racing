Pixel Racing 
==========================
(fork of Javascript Pseudo 3D Racer) [play it!]

Updates:
- touch controls added, for mobiles (see 'touch.js')
- automatic canvas resizing, now fit for all screens
- opens full window (side controls removed)
- performance check removed for higher performance
- works well in portrait layout 
- demo car sprites updated (not they look straight)
- some banners changed for 'better' ones
- driving man moved to right as for right-side driving
- and his passenger girl from the left
- music removed (sound work in progress)
A note on code structure
========================

Keeping the very ide of the original code, so it is still: "In fact, in order to
keep it simple to understand it embeds the javascript for each example directly in the HTML
page (horror!) and, even worse, uses global variables and functions (OMG!)". In the updates 
we've put touch.j separately yet most of changes are in the main files.

Roadmap
=======

- add more than one track
- replace pixel car graphics
- main menu and settings screen
- find sponsors for the banners
